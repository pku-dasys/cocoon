# Cocoon: An Infrastructure for Integrated EDA
Cocoon is an open source infrastructure for integrated EDA with interoperability and interactivity.
It contains a set of cross-tool interfaces and plays the role of EDA agent that can help IC designers 
choose EDA point tools to assemble a legal design flow and to produce ICs with higher quality of results (QoR).
It can also help EDA researchers and tool developer do research on new design methodology and cross-stage optimization.
